    "[Data splitting](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/veda/konference/wds/proc/pdf10/WDS10_105_i1_Reitermanova.pdf) is a fundamental preprocessing step used to divide a dataset into \"training\" and \"test\" sets. The majority portion of the data (say, 75%) is assigned to the training set, while the remaining 25% of data is assigned to the test set. Missing data should be handled before the splitting process commences.  "

In the first iteration, the first 25% of the data is the test set, while the remaining 75% is the training set.

    "_*Y*_ = dependent/target/outcome/response variable  \n",
    "_*X*_ = independent/predictor/input variable  \n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised machine learning, the training dataset is used to train a model that predicts the outputs of a target function, or an estimation of the actual but unknown function that maps X to Y. Here, the model learns the characteristics of the data and its performance is evaluated using a \"performance metric\" - a metric that describes how well it could predict the outcomes (accuracy, MSE, RMSE, AUC, etc.). This gives us a way to measure the goodness of fit for the model on the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also want to see how well it performs on the test dataset, or data it has not yet seen! The model performs well if it has similar performance on the test dataset it has never seen before, because it can be generalized to new data. If the model performs poorly on the training dataset it is said to be **underfit** because it was not able to learn about relationships between the X and Y variables. If it performs well on the training set but poorly on the test set the model is said to be **overfit** because the model performed worse than expected when given new data (although patterns might be due to noise).  \n",
